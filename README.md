# Evolutionary Van Gogh

To run this code, install the required packages from requirements.txt and open the Jupyter notebook (`analysis.ipynb`) for an example of how to run the code and experiments with it.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To start a Jupyter notebook instance, have Jupyter notebook [installed](https://jupyter.org/install#jupyter-notebook) and start it up in this directory.

## Improvements to the code
1. Population initialization: Adaptive initialization methods adjust the population initialization strategy based on prior knowledge or information gathered during the optimization process. 
2. Tournament Selection: Adaptive Tournament size: instead of using a fixed tournament size, adapting the tournament size during process.  
3. Hybrid Selection Schemes: Consider combining tournament selection with other selection methods (using a combination of tournament selection and elitism)
4. Variation: (Exploration-Exploitation Balance) Adjust the mutation probability and mutation strength parameters 

## Feedback from Damy
- Besides the provided "ONE_POINT" crossover, we can explore other crossover methods such as "UNIFORM" or "TWO_POINT" to introduce additional variation. However we should consider using more novel ideas (like three point cross-over)
- Fitness-based Variation: Modify the mutation and crossover operators to take into account the fitness information. E.g. design mutation operators that prioritize changes in less fit individuals
- Population initialization â†’ deduce some statistics from the reference image, uniform initialization	
- We should look into model-based EAs
